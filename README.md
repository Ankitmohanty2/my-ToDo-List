# Simple To-Do List

This is a minimalistic to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.
# Features

    Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by typing in the input box and pressing the "Add" button.
    Task Completion: Clicking on a task marks it as completed with a strike-through effect.
    Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "Ã—" button.
    Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes.

# Usage

    Clone this repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list.git

    Open the index.html file in any browser to use the app.

    Add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks as needed.

# How It Works

    The app uses plain JavaScript to handle task addition, completion, and deletion.
    Tasks are displayed as list items, and they toggle a checked class when clicked.
    Each task includes a close button to remove it from the list.
